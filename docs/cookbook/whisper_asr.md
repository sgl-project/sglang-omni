# Whisper ASR

Whisper ASR checkpoints can be started through the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint, but this path is experimental in the current SGLang-Omni tree. Prefer [Qwen3-ASR](qwen3_asr.md) for validated ASR serving.

## Prerequisites

Install `sglang-omni` by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md), then download a Whisper checkpoint:

```bash
hf download openai/whisper-large-v3
```

## Server Configuration

Whisper ASR runs a single ASR stage on one GPU.

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path openai/whisper-large-v3 \
  --port 8000
```

## Transcribe Audio

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F model=openai/whisper-large-v3 \
  -F file=@tests/data/query_to_cars.wav \
  -F response_format=json
```

```python
import requests

with open("tests/data/query_to_cars.wav", "rb") as f:
    resp = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions",
        data={
            "model": "openai/whisper-large-v3",
            "response_format": "json",
        },
        files={"file": ("query_to_cars.wav", f, "audio/wav")},
        timeout=300,
    )

resp.raise_for_status()
print(resp.json()["text"])
```

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | file | required | Audio file uploaded as multipart form data |
| `model` | string | server default | Model identifier |
| `language` | string | unset | Optional language hint |
| `response_format` | string | `json` | Use `json` for the current Whisper path |
| `temperature` | float | `0.0` | Sampling temperature; defaults to greedy decoding |

The request builder also supports `task` (`transcribe` by default) and
`max_new_tokens`, but the public transcription endpoint currently exposes only
the fields above. The route uses the ASR stage default unless the pipeline is
configured another way. For smoke tests, keep the request minimal and use
`response_format=json`.

## Known Limitations

- This path is experimental and not yet correctness-validated. Prefer Qwen3-ASR
  for validated ASR serving.
- Keep Whisper ASR at encoder batch size 1.
- Use `response_format=json`; other response formats are not validated for this
  experimental path.
- First startup can take several minutes.
- The endpoint accepts one uploaded file per request.
- Audio is resampled to 16 kHz before transcription.
- `prompt` is accepted by the HTTP endpoint for OpenAI compatibility, but
  Whisper ASR currently does not pass it into decoding.
